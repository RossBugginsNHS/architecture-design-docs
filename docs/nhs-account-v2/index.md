# Preface

The NHS, by the very nature of its organisational structure, is an incubator of data silos. What is meant by the nature of its organisation structure? Citizens of the UK (if not the world) hear "The NHS" so often, that few question how it is structured behind the scenes. Who knows how NHS England or NHS Wales differ nationally? Or really how separate each county handles Trusts? Or that in each county there may be many different Trusts hxandling different care? That's all before looking at how each GP Surgery may be fully independent of those around it, with very little in common. However, what they all have in common, are the letters NHS in front of their name.

Common branding leads to a perception of connectedness. That data flows with ease, of common storage and ubiquitous access to all information. Citizens regularly experience the impact of the perception with almost every interaction they have with "The NHS". They may not know the cause, but they feel the impact.

If a citizen being treated at Acme Corp Hospital was told they needed to go to Beta Corp Hospital, would they assume that all the data from the hospital in the Acme Corp would be readily available to staff in hospitals that are part of Beta Corp? Probably not. Just in the same way that if they had a bank account with Bank A and also had an account with Bank B, they wouldn't expect Bank B to be able to show them statements from Bank A, even though both companies provide banking services.

Keeping with the banking theme, it is likely that citizens see all hospitals as if they were branches of the same banking brand. The letters NHS are in big before the hospital name, so they assume connectivity. They see NHS QEQM as a hospital name, not NHS EKHT QEQM.

The NHS has been in existence for so long, that citizens of the UK are deeply in the illusion that it is one sprawling organisation, leading to it being very hard to explain why data recorded at a hospital in Norfolk is not readily available at a hospital or GP surgery in Kent. 

If a patient was treated at a hospital called just Norfolk and Norwich hospital, and then transferred to East Kent University hospital Ashford - would that patient be more sympathetic to the fact that their past data was not there?

There is also the nature of how data is controlled. Citizens rarely understand that GPs control their primary care record - it is "the GPs data", not the Citizens - and ultimately the controllers decide on the sharing capabilities of that data.

We can't change how the NHS has become structured as an organisation, and we can't change the fact that the control of data and where it is stored has ended up as it has. However, we can look at how best to level the playing field, and bring data sharing between citizens and healthcare professionals into alignment, to allow data to be shared safely, and with the consent of both the data controllers and the subject of that data that is being shared.

For Citizens to benefit from the Digital revolution, Developers need to be able to easily and effectively create services and applications for them. For Developers to be able to create such applications in this way, they need access to a standard model of both data and functionality, in a context that makes sense to them.

Developers should not need to work at the NHS for months, learning what systems are where and how they expose their specific data before they can create an application for Citizens. Developers should not be required or expected, to understand the many complexities of the NHS. In fact, should they even need to work at the NHS at all? If the NHS can provide a central platform for Developers, then any organisation should be able to utilise that platform, with their customisation and personalisation required for their specific target audience.  

This paper/investigation/research looks to question not just what data is shared with what people, but how we empower health professionals to ensure data is available for safe sharing and allow Developers to utilise this platform, whilst ultimately moving the final control of what data is shared with who and what, into the citizen's own hands.
