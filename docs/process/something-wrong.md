# How to request changes to this site?

First of all, take a look at the [Github issues](https://github.com/nhsexperience/nhs-experience/issues), as others may already be working on the change. If the issue isn't listed, then first it would be best to raise a new issue. 

Once the issue is raised, there hopefully will be discussion and a decision on if & how to implement the change. This might be changed by the teams here, or it might be requested that a [PR (Pull Request)](process/pull-requests.md) is raised by you or someone else.

## Making change.
All that needs to happen is to fork this [Github]({% link process/github.md %}) [Git repository]({% link process/git-repo.md %}), make your changes and submit a [Pull Request]({% link process/pull-requests.md %}).

There is guidance if you are [new to git]({% link process/new-to-git.md %}) or if you are a [git veteran]({% link process/i-get-git.md %}).

## Submit a Github Issue

If you want to raise an issue, you can do that via [Github issues](https://github.com/nhsexperience/nhs-experience/issues).
