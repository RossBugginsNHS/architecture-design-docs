# Digital Health Check - Discovery - Technical


## Key Items to address
- Identify possible technical hurdles
- How to ensure DHC discovery/future alpha/beta work is reusable easily
- Any key patterns & practices to follow
- Identify any components of existing system that could be utilised / reused in alpha
- Overview of data model
- GDPR / Data - NHS-E as data controller for PII???? (not technical?)

# Discovery Outcomes Summary

- Component Structure for Alpha - National scalable concerns
- Good UI from previous work
- GP Integration = hard
- Question still to be answered - how can digital improve upon and give more benefit that manual health check - instead of just trying to make a carbon copy of existing process
- Question still to be answered - preloading of data
- Question still to be answered - Data in GP record vs data available to GP - what would GP's want / expect
- Question still to be answered - Invite and cohort management

# DHC Technical Discovery Review

**TODO - Write a summary encompassing all work that has been completed as part of the Technical Discovery**
