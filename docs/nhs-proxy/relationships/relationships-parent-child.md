> Babies born in England, Wales and the Isle of Man are issued with a unique NHS number as soon as possible after birth. This goes on to form their lifelong electronic patient record. The NHS Number helps healthcare staff and service providers to identify and match patients to their health records.
> 
> New births are registered on the Personal Demographics Service (PDS). The PDS is part of the NHS Spine.  This ensures that babies are issued with an NHS Number that is immediately available to organisations involved in the ongoing provision and recording of their care.
> 
> Midwifery staff will use one of two methods to register a birth:
> 
> - If they are using a PDS-compliant system, they will register the birth directly onto the PDS. This replaces the NHS Number for Babies (NN4B) service, which was decommissioned in early 2015.
> - If they are using a non-PDS compliant system, they will use the Birth Notification Application (BNA) to register the birth onto the PDS. The BNA replaces the former Interim NHS Numbering Service (INNS). This was decommissioned in early 2015.
> - Once the baby's birth has been registered, the PDS notifies the following services about the birth: child health services, the NHS newborn hearing screening service and the Office for National Statistics (ONS).
> 
> The birth notification service:
> 
> - fulfils legal requirements to notify a birth within 36 hours
> - ensures babies receive an NHS Number to support immediate and ongoing care
> - prevents errors and duplicate registrations
> - supports screening for new-borns and infants
> - enables information to be shared between health and care organisations and
> - enables births to be recorded accurately for population statistics.

## Using the NHS BNS

### Who can do it

**Role Based Access code requirements**
> Access to the BNA functionality is controlled by Role Based Access Code (RBAC). 
> 
> Child health units should ensure that users requiring access the BNA have a smartcard with the following assigned to it:
> 
> - Role	
>   - R8013 Health Records Manager
> - Activities	
>   - B0264 - Access SCR Application (Perform Patient Trace)
>   - B1610 - Allocate NHS Number

# Biological Mother to Birth Child, born without NHS Knowledge


# Married Biological Fathers
Biological Father married to biological mother.

If you are or were married to the father of your child at the time of the birth, or marry your child’s biological father after the birth he will automatically have PR for your child. [^mothers]

**It is presumed in law that if you are married at the time of your child’s birth your child is the biological child of your husband.**[^mothers]

# Unmarried biological fathers
If you are not married to the father of your child and your child was born before 1st December 2003 he does not automatically have PR for your child. He can gain PR as set out below.[^mothers]

If you are not married to the father of your child and your child was born on or after 1st December 2003 and the father is named on the birth certificate he will automatically have PR for your child.[^mothers]
