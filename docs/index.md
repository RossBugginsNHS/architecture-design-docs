# Open Source **Thought**
- Open Source is not just software
- Gov.uk agile process - https://www.gov.uk/service-manual/agile-delivery
- Open Source can start in Discovery
- Think about OS, from the very start
- Open Source our thoughts, from Discovery through to Production
- NHS Open Source policy, looking to add to support not just software

# Who Contributes and our Collaboration Aims

- Initially both Technical and non techical NHS E/I staff

## Going forward..
- Work with NHS D
- Wider NHS
- Wider Industry
- Public

## Want to contribute?
- Please be patient, OpenSource / git / github is new for a lot of people who are being asked to contribute to this way of working.
- We're working with NHS OS Policy team to help us and to feed back on our way of working
- Fork the project and submit a PR!
- Require PGP Signed git commits

# Initial Thoughts on why we should do this
By being open with our ideas and content output right from the start of a programme inception we can:
 
- Remove barriers to collaboration and sharing – open forum for discussion and co working
- Stop documents and strategies being out of date as soon as they are released – tools that support open source, allow us to make documents become “living and breathing” – with continual changes possible
- Automatically publish milestones – open source tools will allow us to easily take the living breathing versions and mark points at where there is a “traditional” version number. This can even be set to automatically publish to a separate web site etc.
- Stop content being silo’d – by being full open from the start, there is no barriers to people finding our research & reduce the sending of documents by email – if the content lives in a public location – then no one has to worry about access to it
- Support FOI and how we’ve got to where we are – tools that support open source allow the history and composition of documents, code and content to be clearly reviewed and managed
- Improve the move from Discovery content to Alpha / Beta code – with the foundations set in Open Source at a discovery phase, its already rolling for software developed in Alpha and betas to be available in an Open Source repository right from the get go
- Improve the visibility of what we do – at the moment collaboration is HARD. It’s hard to collaborate inside NHSE/I, its hard to collaborate with other NHS Trusts / NHS D – and its even harder to collaborate with the private sector. At the end of the day, the public pay for the majority of the work we do – so Open Sourcing all of that work feels right? Over time it may also help inspire wider public to input into any work, and allow us to be transparent in our decision making processes of how we get to where we are, and where we want to be.
- Aid with any future regulatory issues – If any code / APIs / Algorithms do get classed as a medical device – Open Source greatly aids regulators in the assessment. It also is a huge help if a new project utilises the work in the future – as the content and history of the Open Source original becomes part of the new project and if that has been approved before, makes the process a lot easier.
 
##  and possible blockers...

With any change there are always barriers to overcome:
 
- Peoples perception        Open Source can have a perception of “that’s just a technical thing” / not for me / I don’t want the world seeing my work
- Bureaucracy                     There is a NHS Open Source Policy just about to be moved from draft to version 1. Its open source and available to view https://github.com/nhsx/open-source-policy
- Access to Experts            Andrew Harding is our Open Source lead - andrew.harding@nhsx.nhs.uk
- Tools                                 New ways of working / process often need access to tools and software to help make it easier  - how to we make this easy?
- Training                            New ways of working / process often need access to training to ensure people are upskilled where required
 
Hopefully this outlines what adopting Open Source content generation could bring us, and some of the ways we can work to get there.
 

## How we will work

# Licencing
- Hoped to be OpenGov 3 (https://www.nationalarchives.gov.uk/doc/open-government-licence/version/3/). This is looking to be a monorepo - so there may be different licening in samples or source code.

# Why git?

# Why Open?


## Collaboration in the NHS is hard
- Hard in the same org
- Even harder between trusts / orgs

## Agile: Respond to change vs follow a plan
- Living, breathing document
- Clear public history of change
- Stop stale documents being emailed around
- Accept PR's for collaboration internally and eternally
- Open discussions
