## Summary

Authentication, Authorisation, OAuth, OpenId, Enforcement, Decisions, Claims, Scopes, Policies, Roles, Attributes - the list could go on. Auth is hard. It is hard at times for people with a technical background, developers, engineers and architects. It's just as hard for project managers, business analystics and product teams. 

The aim of this paper is to remove some of the magic and mystery that surrounds Auth, hoping to allow a winder audience to have a better understanding of common Auth terms and processes.

It will then take a look at how NHS could utilise these best practises and follow set Enterprise Architect standards to achieve better outcomes for citizens and staff.
