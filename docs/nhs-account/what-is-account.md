# NHS Account: The problem we are trying to solve [^nhs-account-briefing-paper]

The services which people require are disjointed with little information sharing. There is no digital support for some key services. People often have to repeat difficult conversations, or put in the same information (e.g. Contact details, NHS Number, date of birth etc.. ) for various services. We, as an organisation cannot look to deliver a personalised and dynamic service if we do not know about the people we are meant to serve. 

Today we do not have a logged in experience through an account or profile that supports an experience consistently across our channels (NHS App and Website) and beyond. We have the beginnings of personalised services in the NHS App, but this has no memory of previous transactions, or ability to update information held or preference.

The ambition is to simplify people’s experience; and make it easier for them to transact with the NHS by bringing services together, tailoring them to the user’s need and making them accessible from one place.

Our aim is to:

- draw disparate services together, making it easier for people to access things in a single place...
- make people’s data available to them, using data we already have to reduce having to repeat information
- Use consent models, data sharing and a personalised approach to form a ‘relationship’ with a person, learning - over time and applying that learning throughout their entire health journey, enables interventions and - encourages healthy behaviours that keep people well 

# NHS Account - how does it work?

- NHS Account is driving a transformational change in the architecture which underpins our service platforms
- NHS Account connects a number of backend systems, consent models, data sharing agreements, etc required to operate a single view of information across all platforms, channels and devices
- NHS Account will sit behind NHS Login, which provides secure access and authentication. 
- User Profile is a summary of the key information that travels with them across all channels
- This transformational change requires new ways of managing data and information flows so that we can channel information to where it needs to go, process it so we can enrich it and make it more valuable, and join data streams 
 - A new set of architectures is being developed in this programme according to the NHSX Architecture Principles and the ‘Data Saves Lives’ policy.  

# Designing around the person
- We will use the NHS Account to connect people to their health & care experiences
- This rich, personalised and connected experience is made possible by logging into an NHS account through our digital channels.
- We want to make is easier for people to travel across our channels, products and services, we want forms to be pre-populated rather than manually inputted, we want users to have control of their health and needs by setting who they are will to share and not share their details with.
- We want users to tell us what their care needs are but also what their interests are so we can delivery services accordingly.

# An Account-driven experience 
- A multichannel, logged in experience enables us to bring all a person’s transactions with the NHS together, accessed from one place. Whether a digital health check, a 111 journey, covid status or booking a booster vaccine, all can be accessed through a person’s account, making each easy to find and use.

- The account is the thread that enables us to pull all NHS digital services together for a user

- Ultimately, all transactions should be offered inside a logged-in experience to enable services to easily flow, be joined together and persist over time 

- An account will enable an improved contact strategy for people, making more use of digital communications methods according to people’s preference and tailored to people’s needs.

# What is the difference Account Vs Profile?

## Account
NHS Account is the backend architecture used to drive the user experience. It will come from many places i.e. PDS, Spine, Healthkit, PHRs etc… .

## Profile
User Profile is the core set of information about an individual. It will be a subset of the NHS Account where key information about an individual such as long term health conditions, accessibility requirements (visual impairment, physical disability) will be stored and will travel with a user across each of our national channel. 

# Architectural Vision

We have a vision for a central hub for patients’ health and wellbeing journeys, which will enable patients to have a single destination for transacting with services across all care settings.  This hub will enable tailored services to be offered to patients, developed through the Wellness and Prevention programme, it will support new digital services, such as Proxy Access between trusted individuals and across this will operate the Profile, which is a small core set of information about each individual

The Architecture will enable individuals to:

- Establish trusted connections with people and services by leveraging decentrialised identifiers
- Demonstrate their eligibility to access a service by presenting verifiable credentials
- Decide who and what information they want to share using pairwise decentrialised identifiers
- Receive tailored advice and guidance based on information they have chosen to share
