# Citizen Experiance

# Open Source **Thought**
- Open Source is not just software
- Gov.uk agile process - https://www.gov.uk/service-manual/agile-delivery
- Open Source can start in Discovery
- Think about OS, from the very start
- Open Source our thoughts, from Discovery through to Production
- NHS Open Source policy, looking to add to support not just software

# Who Contributes and our Collaboration Aims

- Initially both Technical and non techical NHS E/I staff

## Want to contribute?
- Please be patient, OpenSource / git / github is new for a lot of people who are being asked to contribute to this way of working.
- We're working with NHS OS Policy team to help us and to feed back on our way of working
- 

# Licencing
- Hoped to be OpenGov 3??. This is looking to be a monorepo - so there may be different licening in samples or source code.

# Why git?

# Why Open?


## Collaboration in the NHS is hard
- Hard in the same org
- Even harder between trusts / orgs

## Agile: Respond to change vs follow a plan
- Living, breathing document
- Clear public history of change
- Stop stale documents being emailed around
- Accept PR's for collaboration internally and eternally
- Open discussions
